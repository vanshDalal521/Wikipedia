     <h3>Plot <sub>[edit]</sub></h3>
     <hr>
    <p>
        In a world where hunters — human warriors who possess supernatural abilities — must battle deadly monsters to
        protect mankind </p>
    <p>from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jin-woo finds himself in a seemingly endless
        struggle for survival.</p>
    <p>One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire
        party, a mysterious program</p>
    <p>called the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the unique ability to level up in
        strength. This is something no other</p>
    <p>hunter is able to do, as a hunter's abilities are set once they awaken. Jinwoo then sets out on a journey as he
        fights against all kinds of enemies,</p>
    <p>both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers. He soon
        discovers that he has been chosen to inherit</p> the position of Shadow Monarch, essentially turning him into an
    immortal necromancer who has absolute rule over the dead. He is the only Monarch</p>
    who fights to save humanity, as the other Monarchs are all trying to kill him and wipe out the humans.
